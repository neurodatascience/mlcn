    "We saw regularization using L1 and L2 losses. A third commonly-used penalty is ElasticNet, which is a weighted combination of the two. For the squared error, the metric would look like:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    Err(Y, \\hat{Y}) = \\sum (Y-\\hat{Y})^2 + \\alpha ( \\beta L_1 + (1-\\beta) L_2 )\n",
    "\\end{equation}  \n",
    "Here, $\\alpha$ behaves as it did before: it balances the focus between the prediction error and the regularization term. The additional parameter, $\\beta$ balances the relative weight between the L1 and L2 losses. $\\beta$ values of 1 and 0 are the same as L1 and L2 regularization, respectively.  \n",
